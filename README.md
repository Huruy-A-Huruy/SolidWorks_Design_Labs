Engineering Design Labs – SolidWorks

Author: Huruy Huruy
Course: Engineering Design Labs

Overview

This repository contains the SolidWorks lab exercises completed as part of the Engineering Design course. The labs cover a range of mechanical design tasks, including part modeling, assembly creation, motion studies, and technical drawing generation. These exercises demonstrate practical skills in computer-aided design (CAD) and reinforce engineering design principles.

Skills Demonstrated

3D modeling of components and assemblies

Mechanical assembly design and constraints

Motion and kinematic studies

Generation of 2D technical drawings from 3D models

Design for manufacturability considerations

File Structure

Lab1/ – Part and assembly for a mechanical juicer

Lab2&3/ – Part and assembly model of a two part cabinet  

Lab4A&4B/ – Part and assembly of a water pump with the base

Lab5/ – Part and assembly of mechanical tool

Note: SolidWorks .sldprt (part), .sldasm (assembly), and .slddrw (drawing) files are included. Screenshots are provided for easier viewing without SolidWorks.

Instructions
